This assignment involves loops:

1. Create a for loop that displays 10 random numbers. Random is an object that produces a random number. Below is a piece of code that produces a random number between 1 and 50:

Random rand = new Random();
rand.Next(1,501);

2. Create a for loop that counts down (and displays the count) from 10 to 0.

3. Create a while loop that displays the count of the loops and then asks the user whether they want to continue or not. If yes, then continue; if no the program should end and display a a note saying thank you.

4. Create a do loop that runs until a user enters "Stop."
