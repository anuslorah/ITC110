The goal of this project is to create a guessing game. Break the project into appropriate methods.

The game should generate a random number between 1 and 500.

The player gets 10 tries to guess the number. With each guess the game will notify the player whether the guess is too high, too low or correct.  

If the player correctly guesses the number, the program will stop asking for guesses, congratulate the player and show the player's score. The score is 10 minus the number of guesses.

Use proper naming conventions and document code.

Extras (not graded)

Below are some extra features you can add if you get the basic game working:

When the game ends prompt whether the player wants to play again. If the player responds yes, start the play over, if no, end the game and display all the players scores and their average scores.

Use an array to track scores for the games played.

 

General suggestions: break the game into discrete parts. Test each part and make sure it is working before going on the next part. Draw a picture if you need to, write out a list of the steps in the game.
