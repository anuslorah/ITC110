For this assignment we will create an ASP.Net web page.

In this web page we will allow a user to order a pizza. (For this assignment just assume they are ordering a single pizza) They can choose from three sizes of pizzas: Small, Medium and Large. Each pizza comes with a base of sauce and cheese. Each additional topping adds a dollar to the cost. There should be a checkbox list of toppings containing at least 5 toppings.

The toppings should be contained in an array and then data bound to a checkbox list.

When the user submits the order it should redirect to a page that summarizes the order, gives the total due (Just assume tax is included in the price), and a thank you.

For extras you can:

Add css and format the pages
Add images 
Make it so they can order more than one pizza at a time.
