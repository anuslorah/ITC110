For this assignment we will actually create a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) form.

The form should contain a text field to enter the amount of the meal. A list of checkboxes with Tip choices 10%, 15%, 20% and other. There should be a textbox for other.

The user will click a button to calculate the tip, and the total. In the code we will make a tax amount of .09 a constant. After the button is clicked the form will display the amount, the tip, the tax and the total.

Create a Class called "Bill." that has fields for Tip Percent and Amount and which has methods to calculate the Tip, Tax, and total.

 

To turn in:

Upload the code for the WPF Form and the bill class. Alternatively, upload all to GitHub and provide a link to the repository.
