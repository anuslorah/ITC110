Each of the following is a separate C# console project. Make sure you put a header comment on your code. Use the C# conventions for naming variables.

1. Take in the users first name, last name and email address and output it as "Last name, first name--email", substituting their values,of course. Assign each of the inputs to a variable. 

2. Take in a user's name, address, city, state and zip code. Output it as:

name
Address
City, State, Zip

3. Make a little mad lib--silly sentence with blanks where the user can fill in. For instance you might have something like "There was a ____ from ____ who loved to eat ___ ____" You could ask the user for a Noun, a Place, a Color and a Food and see what kind of silliness results.
