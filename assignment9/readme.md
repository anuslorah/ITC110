For this assignment we will also use a WPF form. We are going to create a little notepad. The form will have a large multiline text. It will also have a Save button, an Open button, a Clear button and an Exit button. Below is a possible layout:

 The save button should save the contents of the textblock control as a text file to the file name entered in the text box.
The clear button should clear the textblock of all text. The open button should open the text file that has its path and name entered into the text box. The exit button should close the application.

You should use separate classes for reading and writing files.
